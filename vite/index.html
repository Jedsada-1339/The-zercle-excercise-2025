      <h2>A. What is the role of the index.html file?</h2>
      <p>The index.html file serves as the entry point for a web application. It loads the base HTML structure and links to other resources like CSS and JavaScript files.</p>

      <h2>B. What is the URL you used to view the page? Is it HTTP or HTTPS?</h2>
      <p>The URL used is usually something like http://localhost:5173, which uses the HTTP protocol (not HTTPS).</p>

      <h2>C. What HTTP status code do you see for index.html? What does it mean?</h2>
      <p>The status code is typically <strong>200</strong>, which means "OK" â€” the request has succeeded and the file was delivered.</p>

      <h2>D. How can you tell the page is being served locally vs from a real domain?</h2>
      <p>If the address bar shows localhost or an IP like 127.0.0.1, then it's being served locally. A real domain would look like www.example.com.</p>

      <h2>E. What tools did you use to inspect the response?</h2>
      <p>Browser Developer Tools (F12), especially the "Network" tab, are used to inspect the response status, headers, and content.</p>
